# reports-boilerplate - Boilerplate for Reports demo application

This boilerplate has been developed specifically for [Reports demo application](https://github.com/survivejs/reports-app). It provides basic [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io) based setup for React development but it has been kept as simple as possible on purpose. As a result it's missing some bells and whistles more experienced developers might have gotten used to.

## Development

* Replacing meta information  - **npm run replace-meta** - This will allow you to update project metadata (GitHub user/project). Note that this can be potentially dangerous since it does just a naive search/replace over *README.md* and *package.json*!
* Developing - **npm start** - This will run a server at *localhost:3000* and use Hot Module Reloading.
* Building - **npm run build**
* Deployment - **npm run deploy** - Deploys the built version
